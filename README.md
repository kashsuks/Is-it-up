# Website Availabilty Using Python - Kashyap Sukshavasi

## Overview

This project aims to check the availability of websites by pinging them and return its network data such as `Response time`, `First byte`, `Last byte`, `IP Adress`, and `Server Location`. It does this by using `Socket`, a *Python* module that uses IP to get data over the internet. The application also has a log that stores the data of all the past searches. It stores the *Status*, *URL*, and *Time of Log*.

## How to use

All you need to do is run the `main.py` file after cloning the project in your local drive.

## Future of project

In the future, we are trying to implement automation to increase the scope of this projects use cases. We are also trying to port this project to an application whether that be `.exe`, `.dmg`, or *Debian*.
