# Website Availabilty Using Python - Kashyap Sukshavasi

## Overview

This project aims to check the availability of websites by pinging them and return its network data such as `Response time`, `First byte`, `Last byte`, `IP Adress`, and `Server Location`. It does this by using `Socket`, a *Python* module that uses IP to get data over the internet. The application also has a log that stores the data of all the past searches. It stores the *Status*, *URL*, and *Time of Log*.
