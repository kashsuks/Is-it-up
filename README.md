# Website Availabilty Using Python - Kashyap Sukshavasi

## Overview

This project aims to check the availability of websites by pinging them and return its network data such as `Response time`, `First byte`, `Last byte`, `IP Adress`, and `Server Location`. It does this by using `Socket`, a *Python* module that uses IP to get data over the internet. The application also has a log that stores the data of all the past searches. It stores the *Status*, *URL*, and *Time of Log*.

## How to use

All you need to do is navigate to the project by going into terminal then typing in `cd <directory name>` and then running `cd websiteAvailability`. Now that you are in the same folder as the project, run `chmod +x run.sh` to make the shell script executable. Finally, you can run `./run.sh` in order to execute the shell script. Doing these steps should make sure that you are in a virtual environment after which you should be able to see the application running.

## Future of project

In the future, we are trying to implement automation to increase the scope of this projects use cases. We are also trying to port this project to an application whether that be `.exe`, `.dmg`, or *Debian*.
